Graphing Calculator made in Synapse X's Drawing API (should work on most exploits)

**Usage**

To put in an equation, scroll down until you see
```lua
local equation = x -- EDIT THIS
```
You can then put in your desired line equation.

NOTE: Equations with an equals (=) aren't supported. (For example x - y = 5). All equations default to 0. (For example: ax + by + c = 0)
